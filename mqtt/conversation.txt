Alan: We're in. Initiating breach protocol.

Bob: Firewall's hot. I'm deploying a ghost proxy.

Alan: Brute-force is too slow-injecting a polymorphic worm.

Bob: Intrusion detected. We've got a watchdog process spinning up.

Alan: Flooding it with false credentials. Buy me 30 seconds.

Bob: Rerouting through seven shell servers. We're still exposed.

Alan: Spiking the kernel. Root access in 3... 2...

Bob: We're inside.

Alan: Copying the files-wait. This architecture is wrong.

Bob: What do you mean?

Alan: It's not a mainframe. It's a trap.

Bob: No. It's a honeypot.

Alan: They knew we were coming.

Bob: Alan, look at the outbound traffic. They're deploying a counterstrike.

Alan: That's not a counterstrike... That's a cybernuke.

Bob: They're wiping the entire grid.

Alan: We have seconds. Can you neutralize?

Bob: I can redirect.

Alan: Where?!

Bob: Back to the source.

Alan: ... Bob, that's us.

Bob: It's either that or global infrastructure collapse.

Alan: Fine. Do it.

Bob: Redirecting in 3... 2...

Alan: TRACE DETECTED! WE'RE LOCKED IN!

Bob: It's looping!

Alan: We can't stop it!

Bob: Alan.

Alan: Bob.

Bob: We're in a loop, aren't we?
