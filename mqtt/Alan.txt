We're in. Initiating breach protocol.
Brute-force is too slow-injecting a polymorphic worm.
Flooding it with false credentials. Buy me 30 seconds.
Spiking the kernel. Root access in 3... 2...
Copying the files-wait. This architecture is wrong.

They knew we were coming.
That's not a counterstrike... That's a cybernuke.
We have seconds. Can you neutralize?
Where?!
... Bob, that's us.
Fine. Do it.
TRACE DETECTED! WE'RE LOCKED IN!
We can't stop it!
Bob.
